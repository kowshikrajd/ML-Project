# ML-Project
Applied Machine Learning Project Submission

#Project 1: Classification of adult income using several attributes such as age, workclass, education etc. with income as the target variable.
This project consisted of three parts:-
a) Explanatory data analysis followed by running several algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression to find the best model
b) Implementing voting classifiers, bagging, boosting and AdaBoost algorithms on the various models.
c) Training the model using neural networks

#Project 2: Predict sales prices of houses using advanced Regression techniques
This project comprised of the same three steps as project 1.
It heavily made use of Feature Engineering and Gradient Boosting
